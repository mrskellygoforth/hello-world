Preliminary Repository
Hi there, my name is Kelly and I am an aspiring data scientist.  
I have been working as a high school math teacher for 8 years, and I was a high school Spanish teacher for 3 years before that.
There's a lot to love about teaching, but I feel like I have outgrown that profession.
I am ready for a new challenge.
I have been learning how to use SQL, Python, Excel, Power BI, and Tableau to manipulate, analyze, and visualize data.
And I have been loving it!
The more I learn about data analytics, the more I realize I don't know.  And that is so exciting to me.  I want to learn it all!
I have also been refreshing my memory on probablity and statitics, as well as linear algebra.  I think I'll review multivariate calculus next.
I intend on sharing my projects on github to display what I have learned so far.
I'm excited to see where this learning adventure takes me!
